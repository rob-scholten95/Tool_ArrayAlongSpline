This simple tool allows the user to specify an array of objects to be stringed behind eachother along a spline. The distance this array travels depends on a variable float, which can be edited and programmed in Blueprints or Sequencer. It is tested and used within this project using wooden train carts.

Known bugs:
- Performance issue when sliding the variable in editor. In sequencer and playtime it works fine.
- Objects wobbling forward and backward when moving.

Planned expansions:
- Particle effects to objects that can use it (trains having smoke stacks, or vehicles having dust being thrown up)
- Having a set speed the array moves along the spline instead of the distance variable and to have these two be easily switchable.
